The game has been created using VC2022.
From main.cpp the game is initialized and then GameManager interacts with the console in the Console folder and the Game in the game folder.

The console and the game are completely separated.

Everything was tested for a 3 by 3 Tic-Tac-Toe but written to be possibly extend to a n by n Tic-Tac-Toe.

The main opens a console in which everything is explained on how to play the game.

It took me ~1:30 to code a compiling code that work and ~2h to optimize, take care of special cases and clean the code.
